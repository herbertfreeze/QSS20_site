# Class Policies

## Student Accessibility and Accommodations

Students requesting disability-related accommodations and services for this course are required to register with Student Accessibility Services ([Getting Started with SAS webpage](https://students.dartmouth.edu/student-accessibility/students/working-sas/getting-started); student.accessibility.services@dartmouth.edu; 1-603-646-9900) and to request that an accommodation email be sent to me in advance of the need for an accommodation. Then, students should schedule a follow-up meeting with me to determine relevant details such as what role SAS or its [Testing Center](https://students.dartmouth.edu/student-accessibility/services/testing-center) may play in accommodation implementation. This process works best for everyone when completed as early in the quarter as possible. If students have questions about whether they are eligible for accommodations or have concerns about the implementation of their accommodations, they should contact the SAS office. All inquiries and discussions will remain confidential.


## Attendance

You are expected to attend class in person; however, there may be times when you need to miss class due to emergent circumstances like illness or other medical reasons, family emergencies, etc. Please do not attend class if you are sick, if you are in [isolation after testing positive for COVID-19](https://covid.dartmouth.edu/isolation-guidance-faqs) (required for five days), or if you have been instructed to stay home by Student Health Services. During the time you are not able to attend class in person, if you feel well enough, you can continue class work by reviewing the recorded lectures (posted to Canvas) and slides (posted to [GitHub](https://github.com/herbertfreeze/QSS20_public)), keeping up with DataCamp, and working on course assignments. However, I encourage you to prioritize taking care of yourself if you are not feeling well or have diminished capacity. If you are unable to continue class work while absent or are out of class for longer than two weeks, I will work with you and your dean to chart the best path forward. While alternative arrangements may be made, this path may also include a recommended incomplete, course withdrawal, or medical withdrawal from the term.


## Absences

Class time will provide you with hands-on experience practicing the concepts and the opportunity to get help from myself and classmates. To encourage you to attend classes, I will be taking attendance. However, given unpredictable travel in the time of COVID and other personal emergencies, you may have **two** unexcused absences without it affecting your grade.


## Religious Observances

Some students may wish to take part in religious observances that occur during this academic term. If you have a religious observance that conflicts with your participation in the course, please meet with me before the end of the second week of the term to discuss appropriate accommodations.


## Academic Integrity

Fundamental to the principle of independent learning are the requirements of honesty and integrity in the performance of academic assignments, both in the classroom and outside. Dartmouth operates on the principle of academic honor, without proctoring of examinations. Any student who submits work which is not his or her own, or who commits other acts of academic dishonesty, violates the purposes of the College and is subject to disciplinary actions, up to and including suspension or separation. Applied to this course, while I encourage collaboration on assignments and use of resources like StackOverflow, the problem sets will ask you to list who you worked on the problem set with and cite StackOverflow if it is the direct source of a code snippet. More information on Dartmouth's policies can be found [at this link](https://dcal.dartmouth.edu/resources/course-design-preparation/syllabus-guide).


## Safety

Masks are welcome at Dartmouth. All students, faculty, and staff are encouraged to wear a mask if they feel more comfortable doing so. Students, faculty, and staff are required to follow [Dartmouth’s face-mask policy](https://covid.dartmouth.edu/face-mask-policy) in our classroom, office hours, and student group meetings. 

To promote the health of our classroom and campus community, please adhere to these safety guidelines:
* **Don’t forget to complete a take-home antigen test [before your first in-person gathering at Dartmouth] after the holidays.** 
* **If you test positive for COVID-19, [isolate](https://covid.dartmouth.edu/isolation-guidance-faqs).** Students must report a positive test to Dartmouth College Health Service at dicks.house.nurse@dartmouth.edu, and also [notify their close contacts](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/your-health/if-you-were-exposed.html). Keep your health-care provider in the loop, and feel free to direct questions to [the Dartmouth College health service](https://students.dartmouth.edu/health-service/department/dartmouth-college-health-service).
* **If you have symptoms, wear a mask around others.** If you feel sick, avoid others as much as possible. If you have to be around others, wear a face mask until you feel better. If you have [COVID-19 symptoms](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/symptoms-testing/symptoms.html), take a COVID-19 test, and if your result is negative, but you still feel sick, test again 48 hours later. It’s good practice to have at least two take-home antigen tests and a few masks on hand. You can pick up tests and KN95 masks at [pick-up locations on and around campus](https://covid.dartmouth.edu/test-mask-pick-up). See [these testing resources](https://covid.dartmouth.edu/testing-health#testing-resources) for more information.

I am obligated to assure that COVID-19 health and safety standards are followed; if you refuse to comply with Dartmouth’s [COVID-19 safety protocols](https://covid.dartmouth.edu/home) (e.g., regarding isolation and masking after a positive COVID-19 test), you will be asked to leave the classroom. You remain subject to course attendance policies, and dismissal from class will result in an unexcused absence. I am also obligated to report you to the Office of Community Standards & Accountability for disciplinary action under [Dartmouth’s Standards of Conduct](https://student-affairs.dartmouth.edu/policy/standards-conduct). Additional COVID-19 protocols may emerge; please watch for and read emails from Dartmouth senior administrators. I will communicate any changes and their resulting implications for our class community.
